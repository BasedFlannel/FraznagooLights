## Fraznagoo approved official colorful audio reacting lights
#### Now with 50% more rainbows

In short, this is just a program I've set up to run a custom strip of RGB LEDs on my desk, and to make them react to light.

The program relies heavily on the [CSCore](https://cscore.codeplex.com/) library for audio capture, FFT, and conversion to normalized spectrum points.

The program is not standalone, and relies on a small server file residing on my Raspberry Pi 2, as well as a small audio light setup. These files will be uploaded to a different github repository at a later date for the sake of backing them up.

If you can find some way to use this code, please, by all means use it. Thank you!
